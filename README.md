# HTML-page-with-JavaScript
dynamic HTML page using JavaScript

The page was created as a project during my programming bootcamp at CodersLab.

Used technologies: html, css, JavaScript

Using JavaScript I got dynamic menu in the header, simple slider in the first section, and simple animation in the second section (disappearing field with the name of chair on mouseover).
